Visuals for the upcomming Dodecaudion concert at Kultura 2.0 [http://kultura20.pl/Community/Default.aspx] conference.

--------------------------------------------------------
- Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------

- Cinder 0.8.3 (http://libcinder.org/)

--------------------------------------------------------
- Running
--------------------------------------------------------
Open in XCode, in the main menu go to Project > Edit Project Settings and set CINDER_PATH to point to your Cinder installation path (at the bottom of the list)
Then do the same thing but go to Project > Edit Active Target 

For proper compilation you'll need the OSC block shipped with cinder and the Cinder-MIDI block which can be found 
at https://github.com/hecspc/Cinder-MIDI (just put it in the blocks folder of your Cinder folder.). 

If You have problems with any of the block (eg. missing files) just delete the missing files and drag them from your location to xcode to update paths. A bit crude method but it works.
